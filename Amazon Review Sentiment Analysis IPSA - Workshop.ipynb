first five books its so poor and secondly the character assassination the snape harry hermione lupin and tonks would never behave in the shallow nasty way they were portrayed to in dh i never liked the idea of snapelovedlily and hoped so much jkr would not take this cliche route not least to have it as the sole reason snape was a good guy lets face it he really believed in blood superiority for every other person but some girl he had a crush on regardless of cruel upbringing thats just not a nice trait he was always vindictive spiteful and bitter rather than a complex antihero who made the right decision in spite of sufferingbr br lupin a good brave caring character suddenly chooses to abandon his wife and child the whole relationship setup was shoddy anyway making the strong tonks into a clingy moping waif like many other harry potter relationships it seemed based more on lust or resignation in lupins view perhaps than genuine lovebr br hermiones potential is wasted on a boy whos mocked and misunderstood her the whole series and in a job she previously thought unworthy of her talk about lowering ones ambitions if jkr was insistant on pushing the relationships they should have been made realistic and the partners made equal instead ron becomes a whiny spoilt child who encourages harry to seduce his sister and ginny after giving herself as a birthday present to harry you
